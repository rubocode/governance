## Strategy

The Colombo aristocracy regained power in 1978 with JR Jayewardena taking over leadership of the United National Party (UNP).
He introduced a new constitution an for the first time the Executive Presidency following the American model.
He also placed the country on a entreprenurial capitalist path and launched a series of large infrastructure projects funded and implemented by the West.
The Bandaranaikes were China-backed.

The new slogan was "ධර්මිෂ්ඨ සමාජයක්."  For the longest time, I used to think that the English translation was "A Just Society."
There was a film in the eighties named "උතුමාණනි" (Your Excellency).  The marketing tag was "යුක්තිය රජයන ලොවකට මා රැගෙන යන්න උතුමාණනි" (Take me into a world of Justice, Your Excellency).
This tag line had mislead my translation.  The correct translation of "ධර්මිෂ්ඨ සමාජයක්." is "A Righteous Society."

Now, the interesting question is to determine of this strategy to create "A Righteous Society" will solve our prblems satisfactorily.
Will the rest of the world just rest and watch as we become _righteous_?  Does it require the rest of the world to become righteous or are they already fully there?
Are we just fooling ourselves or is this a solid long term vision for us to become a prsperous nation?

How will our system of governance merge with the govenrnace system of the rest of the world?  How realistic are we that we can get there with the support of the rest of the world community?
1988 was a whole lot of turmoil with the JVP and the LTTE both in armed conflict with the government.  We wanted to become a developed country but we had lost our way again.
I was selected to the University of Moratuwa after the 1988 GCE(A/L) examination, but the university was closed for almost three years after.

I left for the USA for my undergraduate studies.  I had landed in the most developed country in the whole world.  How did they do it in a couple of hundred years?
Woudln't it be interesting to find out?
