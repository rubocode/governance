Here, is concise brief of the circumstances in my home country when I completed school education in 1988.
I joined the Institute of Fundamental Studies (IFS) in Hantana, Kandy as a Pre-university Research Associate (PRA) in 1989.
I left for the USA for my undergraduate studies in 1990 and this background shaped my journey since then.

In 2028, I will cross the 40 year milestone on that bitter sweet journey.
