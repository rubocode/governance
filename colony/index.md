## Colony

Sri Lanka is a tropical island strategically placed just below India near the equator with a rich written history dating back more than 2500 years.
It was colonized by the Portuguese (1597-1658), followed by the Dutch (1658-1796) and the British (1815-1948).

After independence a united entrepreneurial aristocracy in Colombo (the current seaport capital) took over power.  The Kandy (the central hill capital when the British took over) aristocracy grabbed power via a Colombo based Oxford graduate (SWRD Bandaranaike) married to a Colombo educated Kandyan (Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike the first woman Prime Minister of the world).  SWRD Bandaranayake an elite Christian did a double switch to grab power.  He took on a Buddhist Socialist identity.

He took the populist approach to grab power and had to cater to the whims of the largely uneducated masses.  He created a situation of identity politics (Sinhala and Tamil, Rich and Poor) and the country has not yet recovered.  It has been ideolgical war and swift power grabs since then.  SWRD had a few elite socialists on his side yet got killed by a bullet from a robe wearing monk.  By the late 1960s, the proletariat joined the power struggle backed by Russia and China.  India also intervened (they were Russia friendly and anti US at the time).  Non-aligned simply meant not aligned with the NATO allies.

The Tamil speaking community (primarily Hindu) concentrated in the North, the East and some pockets in Colombo also joined the power struggle.  It was identity politics hell.  Short-sighted leaders created quite a mess.  Since the seventies, the USA/USSR cold war also got intensified until the USA took control in the nineties.  The country didn't know where it was headed.
