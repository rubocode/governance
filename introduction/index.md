## Introduction

> Our world is not divided by race, color, gender or religion.  Our world is divided into wise people and fools.  And fools divide themselves by race, color, gender or religion.

Governance is the practice of ensuring the survival, progress and success of your tribe.  When you realize — at the highest level — that your tribe is humanity as a whole, the scope begins at the survival of the species.  Progress and success are the consequences of good leadership.

As it stands, the world is organized into countries with geographical borders.  The overlapping idea of nationality which is a result of gene pool management within borders necessarily complicates matters.  However, there is no position of global supreme commander — we simply have a collection of leaders of countries (multilateralism).

> How could you say the best form of government is a republic if you think the universe is a monarchy?  
> **Alan Watts**

Even the most powerful leader — therefore — has only a country as his tribe.  They are all competing for global resources and this mandates that each leader to protect and expand a border or acquire foreign resources inside the border instead of the larger good of humanity as a whole.  This is an arrangement for the survival of the fittest — not a global (or universal) meritocracy.  What a tragedy!

There is a search for improvement but ultimately it is also a battle of ideologies about the best system of governance — a blueprint for a **_utopia_** (heaven on earth).  This multilateral competition of ideas leads to conflict and war.  The utopian ideal then becomes **_peace on earth_**.

> Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.  
> **Luke 2:14 KJV**

What would that look like?  How would it work?  What can we do now?  The search makes us wonder what true merit is in absolute terms.  It is ultimately the search for the truth — the absolute truth!

> Ask, and it shall be given you;  
> seek, and ye shall find;  
> knock, and it shall be opened unto you:  
> **Matthew 7:7 KJV**

I have been studying operating systems in this light for a few decades with this large scope in mind.  Merely to understand what is important to separate the wheat from the chaff in the journey of life.  I am sharing the simplified core of my understanding so far.
