## Introduction

Governance is the practice of ensuring the survival, progress and success of your tribe.  When you realize - at the highest level - that your tribe is humanity as a whole, the scope begins at the survival of the species.  Progress and success are the consequences of good leadership.

As it stands, the world is organized into countries with geographical borders.  The overlapping idea of nationality which is a result of gene pool management within borders necessarily complicates matters.  However, there is no position of global supreme commander - we simply have a collection of leaders of countries.

Even the most powerful leader - therefore - has only a country as his tribe.  They are all competing for global resources and this mandates each leader trying to protect a border instead of humanity.  This isn't a meritocracy but an arrangement for the survival of the fittest.  What a tragedy.

There is a search for improvement but ultimaltely it is als a battle of ideologies about the best system of governance - a blueprint for a utopia.  This multilateral competition of ideas leads to conflict and war.  The utopian ideal then becomes _Peace on Earth_.

What would that look like?  How would it work?  What can we do now?

I have been studying operating systems in this light for a few decades with this large scope in mind.  Merely to understand what is important to separate the wheat from the chaffe in the journey of life.  I am sharing the simplified core of my understanding so far.
